// This file has no suggested fixes.
// It also has no corresponding golden file.
//
// Ideally files that don't have suggested fixes are still compared
// against a golden file. (Some test authors may write tests to ensure
// that no fixes are suggested for a given file, and that the file remains
// unchanged after applying (the zero) suggested fixes).
